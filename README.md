# Project Scope

Inventory Management Application using React

## Things Learned

- Installation and proper set-up of React application
- Understanding the terminal and uploading to git via terminal and or VSCode
- React Syntax
- Class vs Function
- Composing Components
- Use of Props
- fetching API data within React
- the render function set-up

## The Challanges

- I made some mistakes on the initial set-up mostly due to being haste in the process and not paying enough attention to syntax

- Sometimes the silliest mistakes could cause major headaches as simple as a spelling issues

- I tried to add the router feature in order to route my nav links, but I had to revert to the original git version. I made some mistakes due to the timing of adding the feature at a later stage of my development process of this assignent. For the final homework, I will be revisiting it.
